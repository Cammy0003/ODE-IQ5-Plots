IQ 5 Assignment
Math 260 (Intro to Ordinary Differential Equations)

Refer to IQ5.pdf in the 'Assignment' directory.

This assignment dealt with establishing a system of differential equations
and solving such in the through linear algebra techniques.

Some solution curves as well as slope field plots, demonstrate the behaviour
of this system. To view the plots, either run the program, or
refer to the plots in the 'Saved Plots' directory.

Note: The plots shown after running the program, may differ from the
final plots saved, since I'm not sure if I messed around with the equations in
the code or not.

Attached is also the calculations performed myself for this assignment.
Also note I got 8/10 for this assignment, due to some minor mistakes, or
things I forgot to do, but overall it is mostly correct.
